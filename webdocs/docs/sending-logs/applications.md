title: Managing Apps

Apps or Applications are an integral part of the LAAS workflow as they help streamline the organization and management of logs from different applications. In LAAS, an App represents a specific application or component within your software ecosystem that generates logs. By grouping logs based on the App they originate from, developers can easily track and analyze logs specific to each application, simplifying troubleshooting and debugging processes.

Creating an App in LAAS is a straightforward process that empowers users to have fine-grained control over their log data. To create an App, users can navigate to their user dashboard, where they will find an option to create a new App. Upon creation, an App token is generated specifically for that App. This App token serves as a unique identifier and authentication mechanism for that particular application.

It's important to note that the App token is a crucial piece of information that grants access to send logs to LAAS for a specific App. Once the App token is generated, users should copy it immediately as it is only viewable once. However, in case the App token is lost or needs to be regenerated for any reason, users have the ability to generate a new App token within the user dashboard.

By generating a new App token, users can ensure the security and integrity of their logs while maintaining control over log access. This flexibility allows users to revoke or update App tokens as needed, providing a layer of control and security in managing their log data.
